\color{red}<Notes to RFP Editors:

(1) Sections 1 to 5 are designed to be independent of particular RFP content and should not normally need to be changed or extended. Section 6 should contain all information specific to this RFP. Additional sections beyond Section 6 may be added if necessary, for example, if each distinct RFP item is more clearly covered in a separate section.

(2) The red text within angle brackets below is provided for guidance and should be deleted from the RFP, as should these notes.>
